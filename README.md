# Enqueue App

It was a service scheduler app that let service providers (e.g. Dental Clinic) to keep track of their schedule and for the service consumers to schedule an appointment on the go. They just have to open up their broswer, search for the service provicer they want and set(enqueue) an appointment. It has a registration for both consumers and providers, and login to ensure credibility and authentication of the users of the app (either the service consumer or the provider).

The app was built using Next.js framework on top of React LIbrary. Database architecture was NoSQL of the type MongoDB. Only Javascript is the programming languange used in this application. HTML and CSS are represented as JSX components.
